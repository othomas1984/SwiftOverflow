## Current State
This repo is a work in progress. It is by no means complete, but should give a one a good example of the following areas:
* Pulling resources from a network, specifically Stack Overflow
* Dealing with asyncronous code flow
* Use of View Models
* Use of Table Views
* Use of Segues (although I don't like them and will eventually replace them with a Coordinator for navigation)
* Use of Storyboards (although I do not recommend having multiple VCs on the same board. I will eventually split them into individual boards)
